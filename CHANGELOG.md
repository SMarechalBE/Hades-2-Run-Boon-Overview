### Fixed

- Dependency to improved boon info UI was not fully removed

## [1.0.0] - 2025-12-17

### Removed

- Improved Boon Info UI is not a dependency anymore, even though it makes little sense to use this mod by itself

- Removed direct use of Improved Boon Info UI since filtering will be provided there directly

## [0.1.1] - 2025-12-10
