## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-12

### Added

- Pinned boons are now shown directly in Melinoë's page. Those can make the button appear and thus the codex page accessible in 
  hub rooms.

### Changed

- Improved ordering behaviour to dynamically handle innate slots and rarities. This should make this mod naturally compatible with any
  mod adding new boons, ordering them in a natural way.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-12-29

### Added

- Improved behaviour when opening codex to seamlessly default on Melinoe's page without impacting current game's behaviour
- Configurable behaviour that opens Melinoe's Boon Info page instead of the current god during an offering. Defaults to true.

### Fixed

- Boons can now be tracked inside Melinoe's page

## [1.0.1] - 2025-12-17

### Fixed

- Dependency to improved boon info UI was not fully removed

## [1.0.0] - 2025-12-17

### Removed

- Improved Boon Info UI is not a dependency anymore, even though it makes little sense to use this mod by itself

### Changed

- Removed direct use of Improved Boon Info UI since filtering will be provided there directly

## [0.1.1] - 2025-12-10

### Fixed

- Melinoe button appearing at all times, even when no run was ongoing. Now it will only appear during a run, after a god boon has been picked. 

## [0.1.0] - 2025-12-09

### Added

- First version of the mod!
