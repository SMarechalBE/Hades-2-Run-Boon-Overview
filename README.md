# Run Boon Overview – Hades II Mod

![Boon button modded](https://github.com/SMarechalBE/Hades-2-Run-Boon-Overview/raw/main/img/MelinoeBoons.jpg)

The main intent of this mod is to help planning boon purchases based on the god pool.

It is a very lightweight addition to the game, a simple added quality of life that aggregates all currently available boons during a run under Melinoe Codex page as if it was any other god Boon offering page. (See above image where we display both Poseidon and Hephaistos legendaries on the same page).


## Highly suggested dependency: [Improved Boon Info UI](https://thunderstore.io/c/hades-ii/p/SMarBe/Improved_Boon_Info_UI/)

This mod is completely elevated by **Improved Boon Info UI** as it brings much more control on the information with filtering and colored boons info.

## Planned updates

- Auto position cursor on Melinoe when opening Codex in most cases
- Add pinned boons to the planner

## Compatibility

- This mod only uses Melinoe's codex page as a container for existing boons.
- It lightweight and doesn't touch to any game components so your save files are safe.
