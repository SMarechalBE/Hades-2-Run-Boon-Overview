# Run Boon Overview – Hades II Mod

![Boon button modded](https://github.com/SMarechalBE/Hades-2-Run-Boon-Overview/raw/main/img/MelinoeBoons.jpg)

The main intent of this mod is to help planning boon purchases based on the god pool.

It is a very lightweight added quality of life that aggregates all currently available boons during a run under Melinoe Codex page as if it was any other god Boon offering page. (See above image where we display both Poseidon and Hephaistos legendaries on the same page).

## Highly suggested dependency: [Improved Boon Info UI](https://thunderstore.io/c/hades-ii/p/SMarBe/Improved_Boon_Info_UI/)

This mod is completely elevated by **Improved Boon Info UI** as it brings much more control on the information with boon filtering and color coded information.

## Boon offering page

During a boon offering page, looking at boon info now displays Melinoe's boon page instead of the current god. 
This can for example help to easily check what weapon slots want for another god in order not to make mistakes.

Note, if you don't like the feature, this behaviour can be avoided by setting the corresponding value in the configuration.

## Planned updates

- Add pinned boons to the planner

## Compatibility

- This mod only uses Melinoe's codex page as a container for existing boons.
- It lightweight and doesn't touch to any game components so your save files are safe.
