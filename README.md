# Run Boon Overview – Hades II Mod

This mod aggregates all currently available boons during a run under Melinoe Codex page as if it were any Boon offering page.
The intent is to help planning future boon purchases based on the god pool. It was also created with the idea to lessen the number of manipulations required to retrieve such an information.
